      <h1 id="about">About</h1>
      <p>Hello, I am a software developer that is very motivated and passionate about my work.
         I am looking for back-end or full-stack experience as I take pride in writing clean and organized code, I love to solve puzzles, and I am very detail-oriented.</p>
      <p>At the University of Southern California, I am pursuing a computer programming minor, in which I have a 4.0 in, and I have spent my free time self-teaching myself and working on projects, like this website.
         I started coding less than 2 years ago, but I hope that my work and efforts prove my desire and receptiveness to learn.</p>
